# Enclosure

The case I 3D printed for this project - could be improved

It was developed using the openSCAD sources from here https://github.com/paulgeneres/OpenSCAD-Projects.

I took the basic Pi Zero case, made it wider and taller - because of the header pins on the Pi and the height of dupont connectors.
